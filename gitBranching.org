#+TITLE: Chapter 3 - Git Branching
* Git Branching - What a Branch Is
** What a Branch is
- When you stage files, git will checksum each file, store that
  version of the file in the git repository, and add the checksum to
  the [[file:gettingStarted.org::*The%20Three%20states][staging area]]
- When you commit, git will 
  1. checksum all project directories and store them as tree objects
     in the git repository. The tree object lists the contents of
     directory and specifies which files names are stored as which
     blobs.
  2. create a commit object that contains metadata about the commit
     (e.g. commit date, author, etc.), a pointer to a tree object
     that corresponds to the root project directory, and if there is
     a previous commit, a pointer to that commit object.
- A branch is a movable pointer that points to a commit object
- The default branch is the "master" branch
- Everytime you commit the master branch pointer is automatically moved
  forward to the latest commit
- To create a new branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git branch testing
#+END_SRC
- The above will create a new pointer "testing", which will point to
  the last commit object
- The above command does not switch to the new branch
- How does git know which branch you're on?
  - It keeps a special pointer called "HEAD" - it points to the
    branch pointer
- To switch to the new branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout testing
#+END_SRC
- The "HEAD" pointer now points to the testing pointer
- Now when you commit, the testing pointer will point to the new
  commit object while the master pointer will point to the previous
  commit
- When you switch back and make a new commit:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout master
git commit -a -m 'a commit to master branch'
#+END_SRC
- After git checkout, two things happen:
  1. "HEAD" points to master pointer
  2.  The files in your working directory have been reverted to the
      snapshot that master points to.
- Once you commit, the branches diverge
- Creating a branch is quick and simple and therefore is encouraged
* Basic Branching and Merging
** Basic Branching
- An example scenario:
  1. You have a production branch on your local system
  2. You have to work on issue 53
  3. You get a call that says you must fix a bug
  4. After the bug is fixed, 
- To accomplish the above in git:
- First create a branch and switch to it (-b flag):
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout -b <branchName>
git checkout -b iss53
#+END_SRC
- Now switch back to master branch, but note that if your working
  directory or staging area have uncommitted changes, Git won't let
  you switch
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout master
#+END_SRC
- The above has reset your working directory to look like the
  snapshot before you branched
- Now create a branch to work on for the hotfix:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout -b hotfix
#+END_SRC
- Once you've committed your changes to the hotfix branch, you must
  merge them back to the production branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout master
git merge hotfix
#+END_SRC
- in this case, the git merge command will move the master pointer
  forward because the branch was directly upstream. This is called a
  "fast forward"
- now you can delete the hotfix branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git branch -d hotfix
#+END_SRC
- switch to issue 53 branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout iss53
#+END_SRC
** Basic Merging
- Once you've finished working on issue 53, you have to merge it back
  to the master branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout master
git merge iss53
#+END_SRC
- Since the master and iss53 branches are not on the same stream,
  they are merged using a three-way merge:
  1. It will use the two snapshots that you want to merge plus their
     common ancestor
  2. Git will create a new commit based on the merger, which master
     will point to (known as a merge commit)
- The new commit will have two parent pointers that will point to the
  last commit from the previous two branches
** Basic Merge Conflicts
- If the same file is modified from two different branches a conflict
  will result if you try to merge the two branches. The merge will
  fail.
- git status will show you conflicts
- The conflicting files will have standard conflict markers
- Once the conflicts have been resolved, you use git commit to
  finalize the merge commit
* Branch Management
** Branch Management
- To list branches:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git branch
#+END_SRC
- The star character next to the branch listings indicated the
  current branch
- To see last commit on each branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git branch -v
#+END_SRC
- To see branches that are merged/not-merged into your current branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git branch --merged
git branch --no-merged
#+END_SRC
- You can't delete a branch that is not merged. Unless you specify
  the -D flag
* Branching Workflows
** Long Running Branches
- One possible workflow is to have multiple branches.
- One branch is the stable branch - ready for release
- The next branch is unstable and the branch after it is even more
  unstable
- As you develop, you merge the less stable merges with the more
  stable branches
- Useful for complex projects
** Topic Branches
- A short lived branch useful for one particular feature. 
- See example above with iss53
* Remote Branches
** Remote Branches
- Remote branches are references to the state of a branch on a remote
  repository
- When you clone a repository:
  1. Git names the remote 'origin'
  2. Pulls down all its data
  3. Creates a pointer called 'origin/master' -> points to remote
     master branch, which can't be moved locally. 
  4. Creates another pointer called 'master'. which is moved locally
- As long as you stay out of contact with remote repository the
  origin/master pointer does not move
- To sync with the remote server you:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git fetch origin
#+END_SRC
- The above will fetch any date you don't have and will move the
  'origin/master' pointer if it was out of sync with the remote.
- You can add multiple remotes and fetch from each one, which will
  create a corresponding '<remote>/master' pointer
- running fetch will not merge any newly retrieve data and the new
  data is not automatically editable
- if you want to work a branch based of off a remote branch you can do:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout -b <localBranchName> <origin/remoteBranchName>
#+END_SRC
** Pushing
- To write your changes to a remote you must push them:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git push <remoteName> <branchName>
#+END_SRC
- The above is a shortcut for:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git push <remoteName> refs/heads/<localBranchName>:refs/heads/<remoteBranchName>
#+END_SRC
- Note that the local and remote branch names do not have to match
** Tracking Branches
- Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct
  relationship to a remote branch
- If you're on a tracking branch then git push and pull know which
  server and branch you mean
- When you clone a branch, git will create a local master branch that
  tracks origin/master
- A shortcut to checkout a local tracking branch is:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout --track orgin/<branchName>
#+END_SRC
- To setup a local branch with a different name:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout -b <localBranchName> origin/<branchName>
#+END_SRC
** Deleting Remote Branches
- To delete a remote branch:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git push origin :<branchName>
#+END_SRC
- This syntax comes from (take nothing from my side and make it be remote):
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch]
#+END_SRC
* Rebasing
** The Basic Rebase
- Rebasing is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another
- Merging takes the endpoints of branches and merges them together
  whereas rebasing takes the changes committed on one branch and
  replays them on another:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git checkout <branchName>
git rebase <branchNameToRebaseOnto>
#+END_SRC
- Rebasing works by:
  1. Finding common ancestor of two branches
  2. Getting diff introduced by each commit of the branch you're on
  3. Saving the diffs to a temporary file
  4. Resets current branch to the same commit as the branch you are
     rebasing onto
  5. Applies each change in turn
- After rebase is done you, you can switch to the branch you are
  rebasing onto and do a fast-forward merge
- The final snapshot will look the same as an equivalent merge. Only
  the history will be different
- The purpose of a rebase is a clean linear history and easy merging
  for a project maintainer

** The Perils of Rebasing
- Do not rebase commits that you have pushed to a public repository
