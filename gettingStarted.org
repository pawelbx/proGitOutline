#+TITLE: Chapter 1 - Getting Started
* Getting Started
** About Version Control
*** Distributed Version Control Systems
- Clients fully mirror the repository
- Different groups can collaborate on a shared repository
** Git Basics
- Git thinks of its data as a set of snapshots of a mini file system
- Every time a file is changed a new snapshot of the entire file
  system is generated 
- Most operations are local to your system 
- Git only adds data.
*** The Three states
- Your file can reside in one of three states
  1. committed - data is safely stored in local database
  2. modified - file has been changed but is not stored in local DB
  3. staged - file is marked to go into next commit snapshot
- There are three main sections of a Git project
  1. git directory - git metadata and object DB of your project
  2. working directory - single checkout of one version of your
     project from the git directory's DB
  3. staging area - a simple file in the git directory that stores
     the names of the files that will go into the next commit
** First Time Git Setup
- git comes with config tool
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git config
#+END_SRC
- lets you get and set configuration variables
- configuration variables can be stored in 3 different places:
  1. /etc/gitconfig file: passing --system to git config reads and
     writes to this file. File contains values for every user on
     system and their repositories
  2. ~/.gitconfig file: specific to a user. Pass in --global option
  3. Config file in git directory - .git/config. Specific to a single
     repository. 
- The more local config files override settings in more
  global config
- setup identity:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git config --global user.name "Pawel Bokota"
git config --global user.email yourEmail@email.com
git config --global core.editor emacs
#+END_SRC
- To view your settings:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git config --list
#+END_SRC
